### What I learned

I got some more practice working with icons and text. My first stumbling block was getting the ethereum icon and the clock icon balanced. This is something I struggled with in a former challenge, but I'm starting to get more comfortable.

My second challenge was figuring out how to do the overlay on hover. In my initial googling, I got a little stuck because I was looking for a filter solution, when what I needed to focus on was an overlay on hover. After getting more specific, I found a solution  and incorporated it into the challenge.


### Continued development

I would love to learn more about CSS filters and make a card flip animation.
